How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User needs can be recorded and later converted into user stories, which aid the team in creating a product that reflects those needs. A user story aims to articulate how a piece of work will deliver a particular value back to the customer. A few sentences in simple language that outline the desired outcome are all necessary for a user story. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I want to incorporate into my future development work?

When approaching developing a program, I would first define the problem that the program would solve, and then plan a solution to that problem.  





What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Good communication skills and complete openness with one another are key to total success. Compromise and cooperation are also vital within a team, as well as making sure that you contribute to the team's success and work well with teammates.
